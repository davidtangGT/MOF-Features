# MOF-Features
Gather features from CIF files. 

Previously hosted on a personal account at github.com/barisoo/MOF-Features

# Overview 
The files allow extraction of features from cif files of metal organic frameworks. Typicvally these extracted features would be using in machine learning models to predict various properties of MOFs. The code gathers:
```number of hydrogen atoms per unit cell```
```number of carbon atoms per unit cell```
```number of nitrogen atoms per unit cell```
```number of oxygen atoms per unit cell```
```number of fluorine atoms per unit cell```
```number of chlorine atoms per unit cell```
```number of bromine atoms per unit cell```
```number of vanadium atoms per unit cell```
```number of copper atoms per unit cell```
```number of zinc atoms per unit cell```
```number of zirconium atoms per unit cell```
```metal type```
```total degree of unsaturation```
```degree of unsaturation per carbon```
```metallic percentage```
```oxygen to metal ratio```
```electronegative atoms to total atoms ratio```
```weighted electronegativity per atom```
```nitrogen to oxygen ratio```


The repository contains:
- A jupyter notebook is included to give better context to the code.
- A python file is also included which would act as a simple module for using the defined functions in other projects.
